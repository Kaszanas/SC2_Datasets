# Architecture example

Below we post a direct ilustration of the architecture we use in with this project.

You can see the relations between components and get the overall view about the architecture which is required to use our API with any StarCraft II dataset.

Every component of the ilustration presents the element of data processing pipeline.


If you would like to use our tools you can find them on github.
