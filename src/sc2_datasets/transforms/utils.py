    Filters PlayerStats events and places them in lists based on the playerId.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sc2_replay : SC2ReplayData
        Specifies the replay that the outcome will be selected from.

    Returns
    -------
    Dict[str, List[PlayerStats]]
        Returns a dictionary containing a mapping from playerId\

    Examples
    --------
    **Correct Usage Examples:**

    The use of this method is intended to filter player's events from the game based on playerId

    You should set sc2_replay parameter.

    May help you in analysing on the dataset.

    The parameters should be set as in the example below.
