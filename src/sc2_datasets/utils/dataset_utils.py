    """
    Helper function that loads replaypack information from a standard directory structure.

    Parameters
    ----------
    replaypack_name : str
        Specifies the replaypack name that will be used\
        as a subdirectory where replaypack .json files will be extracted.
    replaypack_path : str
        Specifies the path to the extracted replaypack.
    unpack_n_workers : int
        Specifies the number of workers that will\
        be used for unpacking the archive.

    Returns
    -------
    Tuple[str, Dict[str, str], Dict[str, str]]
        Returns path to the directory that contains .json files\
        with data extracted from replays, summary information that\
        was generated when extracting the data from replays,\
        mapping information that specifies what was the directory\
        structure pre-extraction, and log file which contaions\
        how many files were successfully extracted.

    Examples
    --------
    The use of this method is intended to download a .zip replaypack
    of SC2 games and unpack the downloaded files
    to the folder.

    May help you to download and unpack downloaded files.

    The parameters should be set as in the example below.

    ...        replaypack_name="replaypack_name",
    ...        replaypack_path="replaypack_path",
    ...        unpack_n_workers=1)

    >>> assert isinstance(replaypack_name, str)
    >>> assert isinstance(replaypack_path, str)
    >>> assert isinstance(unpack_n_workers, int)
    >>> assert unpack_n_workers >= 1
