def unpack_chunk(zip_path: str, filenames: List[str], path_to_extract: str):
    """
    Helper function for unpacking a chunk of files from an archive.

    Parameters
    ----------
    zip_path : str
        Specifies the path to the archive file that will be extracted.
    filenames : List[str]
        Specifies a list of the filenames which are within the archive\
        and will be extracted.
    path_to_extract : str
        Specifies the path to which the files will be extracted to.

    Examples
    --------
    The use of this method is intended to extract a zipfile from the .zip file.

    You should set every parameter, zip_path, filenames and path_to_extract.

    May help you to work with dataset.

    The parameters should be set as in the example below.

    >>> unpack_chunk_object = unpack_chunk(
    ... zip_path="./directory/zip_path",
    ... filenames="./directory/filenames",
    ... path_to_extract="./directory/path_to_extract")

    """
    Helper function that unpacks the content of .zip archive.

    Parameters
    ----------
    destination_dir : str
        Specifies the path where the .zip file will be extracted.

        Specifies the subdirectory where the content will be extracted.
